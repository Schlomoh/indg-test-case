# Last one out loses

### Starting with 20 Pieces:

**Second Player’s Game to Lose:** If you start with 20 items, the second player has a neat little advantage.

#### Caveat

As the first player, no matter if you pick 1, 2, or 3 pieces, the second player can always counter your move in a way that puts you in a bad spot.

### Second Player’s Winning Strategy:

- Keep It at Multiples of 4: The trick is for the second player to always make sure that after their turn, the total number of pieces left is a multiple of 4.
- How to Pull It Off:
- If the first player takes 1 piece, you take 3. Now there are 16 pieces left.
- If they take 2 pieces, you grab 2. So 16 pieces left again.
- If they take 3 pieces, you pick up 1. So again 16 pieces left.

By doing this, you’re controlling the flow of the game. The first player can’t break out of this pattern, and eventually, they’ll be stuck taking the last piece and losing.

### Is the Game Fair?

Not Exactly The game’s fairness tilts depending on the starting number of pieces.

Multiples of 4 (like 20): The second player can always get the win if they play it right.

**If not Multiples of 4: The first player gets the upper hand.**

### Does Going First Help?

It Depends, Sometimes going first is golden, other times not so much. It all depends on that starting number.

### Is This True for Any Number of Pieces?

Yes, this strategy works no matter how many pieces you start with. Just aim to leave a multiple of 4 after your turn.
